# Neural Networks Project

## A web app that recognizes handwritten numbers

This web application was developped entirely in python using the [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) framework.

The project consists of a simple implementation of a convolutional neural network(CNN) in PyTorch. The CNN was trained on the Mnist dataset in Google Colab and deployed in a streamlit app. A number from zero to nine is drawn on the canvas and the CNN makes a prediction to identify the number. 

The demo can be found [here](https://mtdebut-digit-app-app-qpj0lx.streamlit.app/).
